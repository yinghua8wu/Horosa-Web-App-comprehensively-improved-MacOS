**Applies to:** Horosa for macOS (Apple Silicon, macOS 12 or later)
**Last updated:** 2026-07-02

## 1. The Software's License: AGPL-3.0

Horosa is **free and open-source software**, released under the **GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 (AGPL-3.0-only).**

Under AGPL-3.0, you have the following freedoms:
- **run** the Software for any purpose;
- **study** how the Software works and **modify** it as needed (provided you can obtain the source code);
- **redistribute** the original Software;
- **redistribute** your modified version — **provided it is likewise open-sourced under AGPL-3.0 and retains the applicable copyright and license notices.**

**Obtaining the source code:** the complete corresponding source code of the Software is publicly available at https://github.com/Horace-Maxwell/Horosa-Web-App-comprehensively-improved-MacOS. The full text of AGPL-3.0 is provided with the Software (see the accompanying `LICENSE` file).

> **Why AGPL?** The Software's high-precision astronomical calculations depend on **Swiss Ephemeris** and **kerykeion**, both licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. Their license requires that software incorporating them also be released under AGPL-3.0. This is the direct reason the Software uses AGPL-3.0.

## 2. Open-Source & Free Commitment · Official Channels

- The Software is **open source and free forever.** Versions released through official channels are provided free to end users.
- **If any charge ever occurs, only the Founder personally / official channels may do so;** any charging from non-official sources is unrelated to the Project.
- Because AGPL-3.0 permits anyone to lawfully redistribute (and even charge distribution/service fees), **a redistributed third-party version is not an official version;** its safety and responsibility rest with its publisher. Please obtain the Software **only from official channels** (see the Security Statement).
- The "星阙" / "Horosa" names and logos are reserved by the Project, **not granted by open source**, and must not be used by third parties to impersonate an official version (see Terms of Service, Section 10).
